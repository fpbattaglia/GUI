PRELIMINARY STEPS

- install latest HDF5 from sources
from source dir 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx
make; make install
- install zeromq from source tarball, standard config.

- add pyserial to anaconda 

- download the code with 
git clone https://github.com/fpbattaglia/GUI.git


- If you need to change the configuration, you need to run the Jucer. If you used standard configurations to install the dependencies (see above) this shouldn't be needed. If needed, from the source root, compile the jucer 
cd Introjucer/Builds/Linux/
make

- if you need to run the jucer, from the source root 
Introjucer/Builds/Linux/build/Introjucer

- make sure that the anaconda python interpreter is the default one on the PATH. For example run (anaconda_root)/bin/activate (anaconda_root) 
- from the source root directory, run 
./build-linux.sh 

- if compilation succeeds, you'll find the executable in Builds/Linux/build/open-ephys

- compile the plugins by cd-ing to the relative directory and run 
make -f Makefile.Linux
