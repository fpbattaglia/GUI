PRELIMINARY STEPS

- install latest HDF5 from sources
from source dir 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx
make; make install
- install zeromq from source tarball, standard config.

- add pyserial to anaconda 

- download the code with 
git clone https://github.com/fpbattaglia/GUI.git


- If you need to change the configuration, you need to run the Jucer. If you used standard configurations to install the dependencies (see above) this shouldn't be needed. If needed, from the source root, compile the jucer 
cd Introjucer/Builds/Linux/
make

- if you need to run the jucer, from the source root 
Introjucer/Builds/Linux/build/Introjucer

- from the source root directory, run 
./build-linux.sh 

- if compilation succeeds, you'll find the executable in Builds/Linux/build/open-ephys
